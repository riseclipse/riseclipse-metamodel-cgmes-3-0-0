 * Instrument transformer (also known as Voltage Transformer) used to measure electrical qualities of the circuit that is being protected and/or monitored. Typically used as voltage transducer for the purpose of metering, protection, or sometimes auxiliary substation supply. A typical secondary voltage rating would be 120V.
